# Human-motion-detector
Developed a program that detects moving objects in from of a webcam using OpenCV. Through this program, the objects in from of the webcam get highlighted thus creating a grayscale and a black and white image of the object. The motion is also recorded on a graph that shows the in and out time of the object in the frame.
